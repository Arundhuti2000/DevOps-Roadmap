## DevOps Practice Projects (To Be Included in This Repository)

This repository will be extended with hands-on DevOps projects inspired by [roadmap.sh/devops/projects](https://roadmap.sh/devops/projects), including:

- **Setup a CI/CD pipeline for a sample application**
- **Create and run a simple containerized application**
- **Automate infrastructure deployment with Terraform**
- **Configure and monitor a logging stack (ELK/EFK)**
- **Provision Kubernetes clusters and deploy workloads**
- **Write Ansible playbooks for server configuration**
- **Use GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment**
- **Deploy a serverless function on AWS/GCP/Azure**
- **Configure Prometheus + Grafana dashboards**
- **Setup and secure Nginx as a reverse proxy**
- **Implement GitOps using ArgoCD or FluxCD**
- **Simulate a blue-green deployment strategy**
- **Manage secrets using Vault or AWS Secrets Manager**

Each project will include:
- Step-by-step instructions
- Infrastructure diagrams (where applicable)
- Scripts/configuration files
- Explanations of real-world scenarios

These projects aim to bridge the gap between theory and practice â€” helping learners gain practical experience in deploying, automating, and maintaining infrastructure and applications using modern DevOps tools and workflows.
